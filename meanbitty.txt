This is a story of a mean bitty.
Bitty wasn't really mean though.
Bitty was just misunderstood.
But that didn't stop the judge from handing down life without parole to poor ol' Bitty.

But that's not the end of this tail..

for Bitty did get parole for good behavior after some time,
and the people who testified against Bitty all got hacked to itty bitties..
because snitches get stiches.

-The End.
